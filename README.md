Utility to help with trends, it uses [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/]). It helps you format the posts easily and if you run out of ideas you can generate some random questions.

I did this because my clipboard gets lost all the time and it was easier so I thought I'd share.

## Development
If you want to start a development server just install the dependencies with `npm install` and run the web locally with `npm run dev`.

To create a production bundle `npm run build`and to see the result `npm run preview`

It has basic tests, nothing fancy because this was just a tool for myself you can run them with `npm run test`and if you're interested in seeing the coverage `npm run coverage`

## Contributing
If you're interested in making changes to this site, just raise an issue and raise a pull request against the main branch
